= Creational
== Abstract Factory
#image("images/solution_abstract_factory.jpg")
Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

== Prototype
#image("images/solution_prototype.png")
Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and reate new objects by copying this prototype.

#liability[Does not describe how the manager is implemented]

== Factory Method
#image("images/solution_factory_method.png")
#pattern(
  [Abstract creation, Improve Testability],
  [Creation interface on super, implementation in child],
  [Factory method to defer insanitation to subclass (allows superclass to alter type of objects that will be created)],
  implementation: [Testing: override with Mock creation],
  relations: [Setting Context by (Template Method), #combine_with[Abstract Factory ]]
)

#colbreak()

== Singleton
#pattern(
  [Guaranteeing that only one global object of class exists],
  [Some classes should have only one instance],
  [Private construction and static class factory method],
  implementation: [`static Instance()` can use Lazy initialization],
  relations: [Setting context by (Class Factory Method)]
)

#benefit[Sole instance, variable number of instances, flexibility]
#liability[Global variable, tight coupling, prevents polymorphism]

#togglebox[
  === Example
  ```java
  public class Singleton {
    private static class InstanceHolder {
      // Singleton will be instantiated as soon as the
      // ClassLoader instantiates the overlying class

    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {

Convert the interface of a class into another interface expect.
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

== Composite

Composes objects into tree structures and let you work with these structures as if they were individual objects.
#combine_with[Visitor]

#colbreak()
== Decorator
#image("images/solution_decorator.png", width: 70%)

Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
Decorators provide a flexible alternative subclassing for extending functionality.

== Flyweight
#image("images/solution_flyweight.png", width: 80%)

#pattern(
  [Avoid multiple copies of identical (constant/referenced) objects],

*Memento* 
- Stores some or all internal state of the Originator
- Allows only the Originator to access its internal information
*Originator*

*Caretaker* (Filesystem, Database)
- Stores the Memento object of the Originator.
- Cannot explore the contents of or operate on the Memento object.

==== Problem
- Iteration through a collection dependents on the target implementation
- Separate logic of iteration into an object to allow multiple iteration strategies

==== Solution 1
- The knowledge for iteration is encapsulated in separate object from the target
- Rendered idiomatically in different languages, e.g.
  - Java/C\# For-Each statement
  - EcmaScript For-In / For-Of Statements

==== Solution 2
Static Structure

```java
Iterator it = new ArrayList().iterator(); // Initializing iteration
while(it.hasNext()) { // Checking a completion condition
  // next() => move to next // Access a current target value
  // & return that element // Moving to the next target value
  String obj = (String)it.next();

*Intent:* Change Behavior based on state
*Problem:* An entity behaves differently depending on its state

=== State (Objects for State)

#liability[Overkill if only few states, Behavior not in one place]

=== Methods for State
- Propagates a single class with a lot of methods

- Each state represents a table or record of method references
- The methods referenced lie on the State Machine (context) object

#togglebox[==== Summary]
#benefit[Allows a class to express all of its different behaviors in ordinary methods on itself]
#benefit[Behavior is coupled to the state machine, rather than fragmented across multiple small classes]

#combine_with[Objects for State, Methods for State]

#togglebox[
==== Solution
Separate objects into collections according the object state

Kind of individuals:
- *Event* an individual happening, taking place at some particular point in time.
- *Entity* an individual that persists over time and can change its properties and states from one point in time to another. Some entities may initiate events; some may cause spontaneous changes to their own states; some may be passive
- *Value* an intangible individual that exists outside time and space, and is not subject to change.

== Software Design (OOD)
- *Identity:* significant, or transparent (=transient identity)
- *State:* object stateful or stateless
- *Behavior:* object has significant behavior independent of its state

Categories of objects:
- *Entity:* Express system information (persistent). Distinguished by identity. 
- *Service:* Represents system activities. Distinguished by behavior.
- *Value:* Content dominant characteristic. No significant enduring identity (transparent).
- *Task:* Represent system activities. Distinguished by identity and state (e.g. command objects, threads)

== Patterns of Value
Patterns of Value addressing value objects in ‚Äúpure‚Äù OO languages.
#image("images/patternsOfValue.png")

== Whole Value
#pattern(
  [Express the type of the quantity as a Value Class],
  [Primitive quantities have no domain meaning],
  [Recover meaning loss by providing dimension and range],
  implementation: [Disallow inheritance to avoid slicingValue Object],
  example: [`public final class Value{public Value(v){check range}}`]
)

#togglebox[
Represent primitive quantities from the problem domain without loss of meaning.

#quote(attribution: [Henney])[
  Express the type of the quantity as a Value Class.
]

=== Problem
- Plain integers and floating-point numbers are not very useful as domain values
- Errors in dimension and intent communication should be addressed at compile time

=== Solution
- Recover loss of meaning and checking by providing a *dimension* and *range*
- Wraps simple types or attribute sets
- Disallows inheritance to avoid _slicing_
]

== Value Object (Value Class)
#pattern(
  [Make Comparison based on the value],
  [Values by default get compared by the ‚Äúidentity‚Äù],
  [Override methods in object that should rely on content],
  implementation: [Override equality methods e.g. `equals`, `hashCode`, implement Serializable]
)

#togglebox[
Define class to represent values in the system.

#quote(attribution: [Henney])[
  Override the methods in Object whose action should be related to content and not identity and implement serializable.
]

=== Problem
- Comparison, indexing and ordering should not rely on objects identity but its content

=== Solution
- Override Object's methods who define equality (e.g. `equals`, `hasCode`)
- Override `toString()` can help using Value Object
]

== Conversion Method
#pattern(
  [Convert from one (ctr:more generic) Value Object to another],
  [Related value objects should be converted to each other],
  [Constructor for Conversion, Conversion instance method (`toOtherType()`) or Class Factory Method (`fromOtherType()`)]
)

#togglebox[
Use different, related Value Objects together without depending on underlying primitive type.

  #quote()[
    Provide type conversion methods responsible for converting Value Objects into related formats.
  ]

=== Problem
- Values are strongly informational objects without a role for separate identity
- Often Value Objects are somehow related but cannot be used directly without conversion

=== Solution
- Provide a *constructor* which converts between types (e.g. `Year(int value)`, `String(char[] value)`)
  - No additional method call needed
  - Most intuitive when applied to convert from more generic to current type
- A *conversion instance method* converts from a user-defined type to another type (e.g. `Date.toInstant()`)
- Create a Class Factory Method with conversion characteristics (e.g. `Date.from(Instant instant`)
]

== Immutable Value
#pattern(
  [No side-effects when sharing or aliasing Value Objects],
  [Sharing of instances not corresponding to value definition],
  [Set internals at construction and allow for no modification],
  implementation: [declare all field private final, Mark class as final],
  example: [`final class D{ private final Y y; }`]
)

#togglebox[
Share Value Objects and guarantee no side effect problems.

#quote(attribution: [Henney])[Set the internal state of the Value Class object at construction and allow no modifications]

=== Problem
- A value exists outside time and space, and is not subject to change
  - Avoid side effect problems when sharing (or aliasing) Value Objects
  - Sharing values across Threads requires thread safety
  - Values are often threaded as key for associative tables

=== Solution
  - Set internal state at construction and declare all fields `private final`
  - Mark class as `final`
  - no synchronization needed, since no race conditions on the object can occur

```java
public final class Date{
  private final Year year;
  private final Month month;
  private final Day day;

  public Date(Year year, Month month, Day day){
    // range chekcs...
    this.year = Year;
    this.month = Month;
    this.Day = day;
  }

  // ...
}
```
]

== Enumeration Values
#pattern(
  [Represent a fixed set of constant values and preserve type safety.],
  [Fixed range of values should be typed (e.g. months)],
  [Whole Value and declare *enum* values as public read only]
)

#togglebox[
Represent a fixed set of constant values and preserve type safety.

#quote()[
  Treat each constant as a Whole Value instance declaring it public.
]

=== Problem
A fixed range of values should be typed (e.g. months)
- Using just int constants doesn't help
- Whole Value only half of the solution; range should be constant

=== Solution
- Implement a Whole Value and declare the Enumeration Values as public read-only fields
- Prevent inadvertently changing the constants

```java
public enum Month {
  JANUARY(1), 
  // ‚Ä¶ 
  DECEMBER(12); 
  private final int value; 
  private Month(int value) { 
    if (value < 1 || value > 12) { 
      // avoid careless mistakes, check value range throw new IllegalArgumentException(); 
    } 

    this.value = value;
  } 
  
  public int getValue() { 
    return value;
  }
}
```
]

== Copied Value and Cloning
#pattern(
  [Values should be modifiable without changing origins state],
  [Values by Reference modify internal state],
  [Create Copy when sharing so that internal state stays intact],
  implementation: [For deep cloning: non-final fields, reassigned clone. `implements Cloneable`, override `clone()` ],
  relations: [Setting context for (Prototype)]
)

#togglebox[
Pass a modifiable Value Object into and out of methods without permitting callers or called methods to affect the original object.

#quote()[
  Implement Cloneable interface to be used whenever a value object needs to be returned or passed as a parameter.
]

=== Problem
Values should be modifiable without changing the origins internal state.

=== Solution
Create Copy when sharing so that internal state says intact

```java
public final class Date implements Cloneable {
  private Year year;
  // ‚Ä¶
  public void nextYear() {
    year = new Year(year.getValue() + 1);
  } 
  
  @Override
  public Date clone() { /* ‚Ä¶ */ }
}
```
]

== Copy Constructor
#pattern(
  [Copying without a clone method],
  [Within Value Objects what to copy is clear‚Üíneed no `clone()`],
  [Copy constructor consuming instance of same type],
  implementation: [final class, no inheritance, create copy constructor]
)

#togglebox[
Copy Objects without the need of implementing `clone` method.

#quote()[
  Provide a way to construct an object based on another instance with exactly the same type.
]

=== Problem
Within Value Objects we often know exactly what to copy

=== Solution
- Declare the `class` as final and derive from Object only
- Create a copy constructor, which consumes an instance with same type

```java
public final class Date {
  // ‚Ä¶
  public void nextYear() {
    year = new Year(year.getValue() + 1);
  }

  public Date(Date other) {
    // ‚Ä¶ this.year = new Year(other.year); 
  }
}
```
]

== Class Factory Method
#pattern(
  [Simplification and optimization of construction of Value Objects],
  [Construction of Value object sometimes expensive],
  [Use static methods instead of ordinary constructor],
  example: [`public final class Value {public static Value of (int v)}`],
  relations: [Variation for (Flyweight)],
)

#togglebox[
Simplify and potentially optimize construction of Value Objects in expression without introducing new intrusive expressions.

#quote()[
  Provide static methods to be used instead of ordinary constructors. The methods return either newly created Value Objects or cached Objects.
]

=== Problem
- Construction of Value Objects objects may be expensive
  - But those objects often accommodate the same state
- Different construction logic is required which may result in huge amount of constructors

=== Solution
- Declare static one or more creation method on the `class`
- The static methods could also contain caching mechanisms

```java
Order firstOrder;
// ...
Date date = new Date(Year.of(2020));
firstOrder.setDeliveryDate(date);

public final class Year {
  // ‚Ä¶
  public static Year of(int value) {
    // ‚Ä¶ query cache for given year, otherwise: return new Year(value);
  }

  private Year(int value) {
    // ‚Ä¶ this.value = value;
  }
}
```

== Mutable Companion
#pattern(
  [Simplify complex construction of an immutable Value],
  [Mutation of immutable object costly or impossible],
  [Implement Companion class that supports modifier methods],
  implementation: [Factory method on companion for modifications],
  relations: [Setting Context for(Builder), Variation(Plain Factory Method)]
)

== Relative Values
#pattern(
  [Comparison of value object based on their *state* instead of *identity*],
  [Comparison of value objects per default by identity],
  [Override/Implement Comparison and equality methods],
  implementation: [Provide Bridge method (see value object example)]
)

= CHECKS Patterns
Separate good input from bad, (validation)

=== When to usee what?
Reflection
- Deep introspection and modification capabilities are needed
- Building frameworks or libraries that require dynamic behavior based on user-defined classes.
- The drawbacks are acceptable.	‚Ä¢	Large number of similar obj. that differ in characteristics, not their behaviors.
Type Object	
- When avoid extensive inheritance hierarchy for different types.
- Types are known at compile time, and properties don't change dynamically so new class is required.
Property List
- Flexibility in object's attributes needed, with ability CRUD properties at runtime.
- Type safety is not a primary concern or mechanisms to handle it effectively exists.
- Dealing with scenarios where objects can be very diverse and unpredictable, and you want to avoid rigid class structures.

= Frameworks
#image("images/app_framework.png", width: 100%)
Object-oriented classes that work together, privides hooks for extension, keeps control flow.
*e.g.* Hibernate, Velocity, .NET Core & EF, React.js, Vue.js, MFC 

== Application Framework
Object-oriented class library, `Main()` lives in the Application Framework, provide hooks to extend and callbacks, provides ready-made classes for use.
*e.g.* Spring, J2EE, ASP.NET, Angular, Office, Apache, httpd, quote

== Micro Frameworks
Represented by many Design Patterns *e.g.* Template Method, Strategy, Command Processor

== Meta Framework
*Framework adaption concerns:* Acquisition cost, Long-term effect, Training and support, future technology plans, Competitor responsible
*Key Ideas:* Difference to other technologies, different usage contexts.

= Frameworkers Dilemma
*Usage:* Framework users implement application code by
*Portability:* Code strongly coupled to overlying Framework
*Testability:* Hard to take single piece/package and write automated unit tests for application classes using Framework
*Evolution:* Framework users implementation might break in next version 
=> Check out *functional* and *non-functional* requirements and *evaluate* Framework with care, *before* get locked-in.

*Ways out of dilemma:* 1. Think very hard up-front, 2. Don't care too much bout framework users, 3. Let framework users participate, 4. Use helping technology

= POSA 1 & 3
